 Q1: Find the 2nd highest salary from employees.  
 -------------------------------------------------

ðŸ’¡ Logic in Simple Words:
Think of salaries like medals in a race:
ðŸ¥‡ Gold â†’ Highest Salary  
ðŸ¥ˆ Silver â†’ 2nd Highest Salary  
ðŸ¥‰ Bronze â†’ 3rd Highest, and so on...

We donâ€™t want the gold here, we want the silver!  
That means: Skip the highest salary, then pick the next one.

ðŸš€ Solution:
*/
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 1 ROW FETCH NEXT 1 ROW ONLY;

/*
âœ¨ Breakdown:
1. ORDER BY salary DESC â†’ arrange from biggest to smallest.  
2. OFFSET 1 â†’ skip the 1st (gold medal salary).  
3. FETCH NEXT 1 â†’ grab the very next one (silver salary).  

Boom! Thatâ€™s your 2nd highest salary ðŸ¥ˆ
