-- üí° Solution
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, DepartmentID, Salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        EmployeeID,
        EmployeeName,
        DepartmentID,
        Salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY DepartmentID ORDER BY Salary DESC) AS rnk
    FROM Employees
) sub
WHERE rnk <= 2;

/*

-- üéâ Explanation
We use `DENSE_RANK()` to rank employees by salary within each department.  
Unlike `ROW_NUMBER`, it handles ties properly üë•.  
Filtering `rnk <= 2` gives us the **top 2 salary levels** per department üèÜ.
