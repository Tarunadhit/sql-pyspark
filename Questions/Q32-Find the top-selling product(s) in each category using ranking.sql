SELECT 
    CategoryID,
    ProductName,
    Sales,
    RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY CategoryID 
        ORDER BY Sales DESC
    ) AS SalesRank
FROM Products
WHERE RANK() OVER (
        PARTITION BY CategoryID 
        ORDER BY Sales DESC
    ) = 1;
/*
-- üéâ Explanation
- `RANK()` assigns rank **within each category**.  
- `PARTITION BY CategoryID` makes the ranking restart for every category.  
- `ORDER BY Sales DESC` ranks products by sales (highest = rank 1).  
- Filtering for `= 1` gives us the **top-seller(s)** in each category.  

This way, we can easily see the **best-performing product üèÜ in every category**.
