## 🔑 Why Learn SQL & PySpark?  

- **SQL (Structured Query Language)**  
  - The foundation of data analysis.  
  - Helps you interact with relational databases.  
  - Universally used across industries.  

- **PySpark (Python + Spark)**  
  - Built for **big data**.  
  - Allows distributed computing across huge datasets.  
  - Scales seamlessly from a laptop to a cluster.  

Together, they bridge the gap between **structured database querying** and **scalable big data processing**.
